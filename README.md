## ‚ú® Features

*   **üìä Interactive Salary Prediction:** Easily predict salaries using a Streamlit-powered web interface.
*   **üöÄ Pre-trained Model:** Leverages a robust, pre-trained machine learning model (`model3.pkl`) for quick and accurate predictions.
*   **üê≥ Dockerized Deployment:** Comes with a `Dockerfile` for easy containerization and deployment across different environments.
*   **üêç Python-centric Development:** Built entirely with Python, making it accessible for Python developers and data scientists.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Development Container Support:** Includes `.devcontainer` configuration for a seamless and consistent development experience with VS Code.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the Salary Predictor App up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python package installer)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (for cloning the repository)
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (optional, for containerized deployment)

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/H-lamba/Salary-Predictor-App.git
cd Salary-Predictor-App
```

### 2. Manual Installation (Recommended)

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Docker Installation (Containerized Deployment)

If you prefer to run the application using Docker:

1.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    Navigate to the project root directory and build the Docker image.

    ```bash
    docker build -t salary-predictor-app .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker Container:**
    Once the image is built, you can run the application in a container.

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 salary-predictor-app
    ```

    The application will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### 4. VS Code Dev Container (Development Environment)

If you are using VS Code, you can leverage the provided `.devcontainer` setup for a consistent development environment:

1.  **Install VS Code Remote - Containers Extension:**
    Make sure you have the [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed in VS Code.

2.  **Reopen in Container:**
    Open the `Salary-Predictor-App` folder in VS Code. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

    This will build the development container and automatically install all dependencies, setting up your environment.


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once installed, you can run the Streamlit application to start predicting salaries.

### Running the Application

1.  **Activate your virtual environment** (if using manual installation):

    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

2.  **Start the Streamlit app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    The application will automatically open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Interacting with the App

*   **Input Parameters:** Use the interactive widgets (sliders, dropdowns, text inputs) on the left sidebar to provide details such as experience, education level, role, etc.
*   **Get Prediction:** As you adjust the inputs, the application will display the predicted salary based on the pre-trained model.
